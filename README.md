#### *Unimportant questions about why Seinfeld wasn’t funny the first few seasons.*

Analyzing dialogue from each episode’s script, by character and by season, what can we learn about how the show evolved, from no buzz (circa seasons 1-3) to TV darling (seasons 5-9)?    

1.	How did each character’s share of dialogue change as the show progressed from season to season?  Did Jerry initially have an outsized share of the dialogue?  

2.	Did the writers reach some magic equilibrium/balance in terms of how they shared dialogue and/or distributed storylines between the four main characters?     

## Data
The data, posted and downloaded as a csv on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles), was originally scraped from the fan website [seinology.com](http://www.seinology.com/). 

## Analysis
Intial filtering, exploration, and analysis, as a % of words by season and character, done in this [notebook](https://github.com/atd124/Did-you-ever-notice/blob/main/analysis/Seinfeld%20Script%20Analysis.ipynb) with the pandas Python library.  Additional cleaning, analysis, and chart mockups done in this [Excel file](https://github.com/atd124/Did-you-ever-notice/blob/main/data/Seinfeld_scripts.csv).
